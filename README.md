Photos and photo topos of Tahquitz
==================================

These are photos and photo topos for climbs at Tahquitz. In most cases
I've done the climb several times, tried different variations, etc.,
but there is no guarantee that my information is correct. If you find
mistakes or have suggestions for improvements, please contact me using
the contact info at http://www.lightandmatter.com/area4author.html ,
or post a comment on mountainproject.

Because the files are fairly large, this repository only includes the
vector art, in the form of editable Inkscape files, and the photos
that go into those files as backgrounds.  It doesn't include the
output rendered to a bitmapped image. If all you want is a photo topo that
you can conveniently print out or access on your phone, then the easiest
way to get those is from the relevant pages on Wikimedia Commons
or Mountainproject:
